# pdf-to-markdown

I have searched a lot of solutions for converting pdf to markdown and some where fine, they would get the text but struggled getting the tables. I have created a small script which would convert the pdf to markdown **(almost) reliably**.

## Developer notes

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.1. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
